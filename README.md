# Rainbow Circles

#### You're given an HTML file with three nested divs, each with a unique ID. Using only CSS, style the HTML to have the appearance of six concentric coloured circles.

<ins>**From outside to inside, the circles should have the following characteristics:**</ins>

- 300px by 300px, `#ff0000`
- 250px by 250px, `#ffa500`
- 200px by 200px, `#ffff00`
- 150px by 150px, `#008000`
- 100px by 100px, `#0000ff`
- 50px by 50px, `#800080`

While there are a variety of ways to achieve this desired output, for the purpose of this problem all colours should be achieved using background colours and/or box model properties.

**Output:**
